                <h4>Hello ! </h4>

                    <p> So glad that you are passing through to get to know us. I am an adventurous photographer currently living in Charlotte, North Carolina.
                    I started out with mostly urban and landscape photography, and most recently discovered a passion in shooting portraits. After shooting my first portrait shoot, I was hooked.
                    I try to resemble the excitement and emotions displayed on our client through my photos. Portrait photography tells a unique story, it captures the real moments that tell YOUR story.</p>
